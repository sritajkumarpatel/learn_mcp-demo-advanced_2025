# MCP Demo — Advanced (frontend-only)

This is a small demo that simulates key MCP features:

- Memory (uses browser localStorage)
- Tools: time and a simple safe calculator
- Safety filter (blocks dangerous/privacy-related inputs)
- Simple logs/observability (console + in-UI log panel)

## Run locally (VS Code)

1. Create a folder and add the files.
2. Open in VS Code.
3. (Optional) Install Live Server extension.
4. Right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server, or open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Commit and push files.
3. In repo Settings → Pages, select branch `main` and root folder → Save.
4. GitHub Pages will publish a URL (may take a minute).

## Notes

- This is a learning demo. Do NOT rely on this for production safety/privacy.
